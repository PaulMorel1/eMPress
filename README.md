# Empress

Minimalist FOSS blog platform for the 21st century based on Gatsby.

Created by Evan X. Merz.

## Philosophy

The name comes from M-Press, which stands for 
Modern, or Minimalist, version of WordPress. I
originally started this project as a modern, 
static alternative to WordPress that I could 
host for as close to free as possible on AWS.
The goal is a blogging platform for the 21st
century that has all the core features of a 
static blog, without any bloat.

### But why no SASS? Styled Components? Typography?

When I tried to set up a Gatsby blog using other starters,
I found that I couldn't upgrade to the latest version of
major dependencies, such as Gatsby, due to a broken web of
dependencies. For this reason I wanted to keep this blog
as vanilla as possible.

You can add any libraries that you like.

## Requirements

To use it out-of-the-box as a blog platform, you need
the following things.
