# eMPress

Minimalist FOSS blog platform for the 21st century based on Gatsby.

Created by Evan X. Merz.

## Philosophy

This is not a starter.
It's a full fledged static blog.

But it also follows a minimalist philosophy,
both in source and in style.

Everything here is a core feature.

### But why no SASS? Styled Components? Typography?

When I tried to set up a Gatsby blog using other starters,
I found that I couldn't upgrade to the latest version of
major dependencies, such as Gatsby, due to a broken web of
dependencies. For this reason I wanted to keep this blog
as vanilla as possible.

You can add any libraries that you like.
