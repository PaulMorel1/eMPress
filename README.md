# Empress

Full featured Gatsby blog starter that allows you to focus on your blog, rather than your code.

Created by Evan X. Merz.

## Philosophy

The name comes from M-Press, which stands for 
Modern, or Minimalist, press. I
originally started this project as a modern, 
static alternative to WordPress that I could 
host for as close to free as possible on AWS.
The goal is a blog for the 21st
century that has all the core features of a 
static blog, without any bloat.

### But why no SASS? Styled Components? Typography?

When I tried to set up a Gatsby blog using other starters,
I found that I couldn't upgrade to the latest version of
major dependencies, such as Gatsby, due to a broken web of
dependencies. For this reason I wanted to keep this blog
as vanilla as possible.

You can add any libraries that you like.

## Requirements

To use it out-of-the-box as a blog, you need
the following things.

- a free GitHub account
- a free AWS account
- knowledge of git and markdown

## Features

- Tags
- Menus
- Markdown posts
- Themes
- TODO: Automatic deployment to AWS
- TODO: Google Analytics


## Development

It's a minimalist gatsby project.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

## Deploy on AWS using GitHub Actions

If you are using the built-in GitHub Actions integration, then just commit your new stuff and push to master on GitHub.
