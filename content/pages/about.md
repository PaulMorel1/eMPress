Empress is a Free Open Source blog platform based on Gatsby. It's a minimalist extension of the code you write in the Gatsby tutorial that includes most common features of blogs and implies a structure related to that of a WordPress blog.

The name is supposed to mean a Modern take on WordPress, but that's only because I started creating this when I was frustrated with WordPress. WordPress continues to rely on obsolete technology that was central to the web when it was created, such as FTP. So I started this project with the goal of creating a blogging platform similar to WordPress but without any obsolete technology (as of 2021) interfering in the code or platform.

About a week in, I realized that that goal was sort of misguided. I don't want a "modern WordPress"; I want a blog platform based on technologies that are familiar to me in 2021, regardless of what is in WordPress.

Maybe that difference is subtle.

But here's the TLDR:
- Free and Open Source
- Minimalist
- No reliance on tools from the 1990s
- Can be hosted for as cheap as possible on AWS. I don't think it's possible to host a blog more cheaply.
- Can be automatically deployed using GitHub Actions.
