An Empress Blog frees you up to write, while providing the fastest, cheapest blog possible. It's essentially a finished Gatsby blog starter. It has all the features of a static blog with none of the bloat.

The best thing about it is that it enables you to run a blog as cheaply as possible using AWS S3 and CloudFront. Most of the time, a blog hosted this way will be free. And how do you deploy to it? Using continuous integration provided by GitHub Actions all you have to do us push a commit to the master branch.

So pull the trigger. Fork Empress Blog and start your own media empire!
