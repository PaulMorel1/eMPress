This post will walk you through the process of setting up your blog for the first time. This may take a little work, but at the end you will have a blazing fast blog that you can host for as close to free as possible.

1. Sign up for GitHub.
2. Sign up for AWS. Set up an S3 bucket and a CloudFront distribution for it.
3. Fork the project from https://github.com/PaulMorel1/eMPress. When you form a project, you are essentially making your own copy of it.
4. Download SourceTree and set up your git project locally.
5. Download a markdown editor and write a post. Save it into the content/posts folder of your project.
6. Commit the new post and push it to GitHub.
