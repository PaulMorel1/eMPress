This post will walk you through the process of setting up your blog for the first time. This may take a little work, but at the end you will have a blazing fast blog that you can host for as close to free as possible.

1. Sign up for [GitHub](https://www.github.com). You don't actually need to use GitHub unless you want to use the included GitHub Actions deployment.
2. Fork the repository at [https://github.com/PaulMorel1/eMPress](https://github.com/PaulMorel1/eMPress). This makes your own copy of it.
3. Sign up for AWS.
4. Set up an S3 bucket for your site.
5. Set up a CloudFront distribution for your S3 bucker.
6. Download SourceTree and set up your git project locally.
7. Download a markdown editor and write a post. Save it into the content/posts folder of your project.
8. Commit the new post and push it to GitHub.
