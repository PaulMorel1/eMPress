To register a new domain using AWS, you must use a service called Route 53.

1. Log into AWS management console at [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Find the service Route 53 and click it.
3. Open the sidebar on the left side of the page.
4. Click "Registered Domains" then click the button that says "Register Domain".
5. Enter the domain name you want and click the check button. Your domain may already be taken, so you may have to be creative to find the right domain.
6. When you find a free one that you like, add it to your cart and check out.
